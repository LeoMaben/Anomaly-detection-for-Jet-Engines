# Anomaly-detection-for-Jet-Engines

## Overview

This project involves building an ML model to work with multiple multivariate time series and tackle the identification
of anomalies. The end goal is to prepare a predictive maintenance model.

## Goals:

- EDA
- SVM 
- Distributed lag models
- RUL
- Random Forest
- Lagged MLP
- LSTM
